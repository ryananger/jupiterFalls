#### [Jupiter Falls Demo](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjiPB2ffzPI "Jupiter Falls Demo")
### An educational math game for mobile and web, built with React and html5 Canvas.

#### Status: In development.

This started as my 'Minimum Viable Product' project for Hackreactor's 12-week immersive program, in which I was given 48 working hours to build an app from scratch.

I have since expanded on gameplay and assets, ported from ReactJS to ReactNative, and I am in the process of polishing UI and configuring user authentication and database for production.
